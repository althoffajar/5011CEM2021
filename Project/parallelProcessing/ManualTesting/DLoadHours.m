    % We do this by indexing through the model names, then defining the
    % start position as the beginnning of the Lat, beginning of the Lon and
    % beginning of the new hour. We then define the number of elements
    % along each data dimension, so the total number of Lat, the total
    % number of Lon, but only 1 hour.

%     % Define the function to call when new data is received in the data queue
%     % 'DataQ'. See end of script for the function definition.
